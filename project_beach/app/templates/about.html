            <h1>Luna's Story:</h1>

            <p>
                Once upon a time, in a distant future, there lived a brilliant llama named Luna. 
                Luna wasn't your ordinary llama; she had a deep fascination with mathematics and a burning desire to save her planet, 
                Llamatopia, from an impending disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
                Llamatopia was a beautiful world filled with rolling green hills and vibrant forests. However, it faced 
                a dire threat from a massive asteroid hurtling toward it. Luna knew that the only way to save her beloved 
                planet was through mathematics.
            </p>
                
            <div style= "float:left;position: relative; right: 10px;">
                <img src="./static/images\llama_pics\326845_Mathmaticus_ll_xl-1024-v1-0.png" width="200"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                Luna, being the determined and resourceful llama that she was, decided to build a spaceship powered by 
                the magic of mathematics. She started by designing the most advanced and intelligent computer known to 
                llama-kind, which she affectionately named "Mathmaticus."
            </p>

            <div style= "float:right;position: relative; left: 10px;">
                <img src="./static/images\llama_pics\678625_space_llama_doing_math_xl-1024-v1-0.png" width="200"/>
            </div>

            <p>
                With Mathmaticus by her side, Luna embarked on her epic journey into space. She knew that to alter the 
                asteroid's trajectory, she would need to calculate the perfect angle and force to intercept it. Luna 
                spent days, weeks, and even months crunching numbers, solving equations, and simulating different scenarios. 
                She used calculus to predict the asteroid's path and algebra to determine the best course of action. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As Luna and Mathmaticus approached the asteroid, Luna used her newfound knowledge of trigonometry 
                to calculate the precise angle and velocity needed to intercept it. With bated breath, she executed 
                the maneuver. The spaceship hurtled toward the asteroid, and at the last moment, Luna deployed a set 
                of specially designed mathematical thrusters, which changed the asteroid's trajectory ever so slightly.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tension was palpable as Luna and Mathmaticus watched their calculations come to life. Slowly but 
                surely, the asteroid's course changed, and it veered away from Llamatopia, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic 
                collision. The planet was safe, and the llama inhabitants cheered in jubilation.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Luna's incredible mathematical skills had saved Llamatopia from destruction. She returned to her home planet, 
                celebrated as a hero, and continued to explore the wonders of mathematics, using her knowledge to improve the
                lives of all llamas.
            </p>

            <p>
                And so, the story of Luna, the llama who used math to save her planet from an asteroid, became a legend in 
                Llamatopia, reminding everyone of the power of knowledge, determination, and the incredible potential of 
                llamas in space.
